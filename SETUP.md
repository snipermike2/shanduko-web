## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Frontend (Next.js 14)
- **App Router**: File-based routing
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **PWA**: Manifest + Service Worker

- **Cloud Mode**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **API Layer**: lib/api.ts handles both modes

### Components
- **Layout**: Responsive shell with navigation
- **Charts**: Recharts with animations
- **Maps**: Mapbox GL JS with Leaflet fallback
- **Forms**: Photo upload, location picker
- **Gamification**: Points, badges, streaks

### Features
- **Real-time**: Auto-refresh every 30s
- **Offline**: Service Worker caching
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design
- **Accessible**: WCAG compliance
- **Performance**: Optimized bundles

## üì± Production Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel
```

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Environment Variables for Production
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Map doesn't load:**
- Check console for Mapbox/Leaflet errors
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN (or rely on Leaflet fallback)

**Supabase connection fails:**
- Verify environment variables
- Check Supabase project status
- Review RLS policies in database

**PWA install doesn't work:**
- Ensure HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Check manifest.webmanifest is accessible
- Verify service worker registration

**Charts don't animate:**
- Check "Animated Charts" toggle in Settings
- Verify Recharts import is working
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Performance Issues
- Run `npm run build` to check bundle size
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Enable Supabase connection pooling for high traffic

## üîß Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Production server
npm run lint         # ESLint check
npm run type-check   # TypeScript check
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Analytics
